                    <p>The purpose of the project is to help the Anime fan/viewers to get a recommendations for Animes.
                        I decided to work on this project because being a big fan of Anime myslef, at times I would want to look for anime that are similar to certain Animes and had to google it and ask other people. I just thought it was a complicated process. So, I just decided to make an app myself that will help to solve that issue.
                        Besides getting the recommendations for Animes, users can also search for Animes, and view trending and upcoming Animes like they can in other sites.</p>

                    <p>I worked on this project cause I was really fascinated by the idea of how these pathfinding algorithm would look in visualization.
                        I had learned about A* algorithm in my Spring 2020 semester, and with A* and all the other pathfinding algorithms running inside my head,
                        I was struck with the idea of how would they look like in visualization. And then I came across with this A* visualization online.
                        I thought that was really cool, then I decided that I was gonna do dijkstra algorithm. Although it wasn't a long project, I really had fun working on it.</p>

                    <p>I worked on a COVID Travel Log web app that allows users to plan their trips according to the severity of the current global pandemicâ€™s impact.
                        During/after this pandemic, it's quite difficult to find a comparatively safest place to travel. So, I decided make an app that will show the information about deaths,
                        and confirmed COVID cases in different places, so the users can plan their trip based on the impact COVID has on that certain place. Users can create logs for the places
                        they have visited and the places that they are interested to visit.</p>
